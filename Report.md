# Analysis of Streaming Protocols in YouTube Video Transmission Performance and Quality Assessment

Nowadays, online video streaming has become a fundamental application of multimedia systems, and its
quality and experience depend on two key factors: decoding capability and network environment. These
factors are crucial in terms of loading speed, frame quality, and effective utilization of bandwidth. On the other
hand, for modern computers, the GPUs provide major video decoding capabilities. Therefore, this project aims
to provide a comprehensive assessment of the network environment and GPU decoding capability applicable
to YouTube video transmission.


This study relies on both controlled experiments and real-world testing to offer a comprehensive analysis.
Analyzing objective performance data paints a comprehensive picture of how the network environment and
GPU decoding capability influence streaming quality and the user experience.

## INTRODUCTION
In the modern era of digital communication, online video content revolutionizes the way we access
and consume multimedia. Platforms like YouTube emerge as ubiquitous sources of information,
entertainment, and education, seamlessly delivering video content to a global audience. However,
the seamless and high-quality experience that users enjoy is not a mere coincidence but the result
of a complex interplay of technology, infrastructure, and protocols.

On another front, the physical network infrastructure bears the responsibility of carrying and
transporting these protocols. A multitude of servers and backbone networks transmit video data to
end-users with the assistance of transmission protocols. Given that network devices operate in
the real world, packet loss, latency, and limited bandwidth are inevitable. These circumstances can
significantly impact both the transmission process and the quality of the video.

Additionally, the process of translating transmission protocols and compressed data into signals
perceptible by human senses is a significant undertaking. In this context, video decoding holds
particular importance, especially in terms of decoding speed and quality. For modern computers,
the GPU takes the most of the workload. Itâ€™s noteworthy that, with the rapid advancement of
technology, both the performance and prices of GPUs have significantly increased. This situation
has led to the continued use of some older devices that have not been phased out. The question
arises as to whether these GPUs can keep pace with the progress in modern video technology,
specifically concerning aspects such as playing 4K or higher resolution videos.

In conclusion, the video experience for end-users is significantly influenced by both the network
environment and GPU performance. Therefore, the objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of YouTube video streaming performance and quality by analyzing various
factors that impact the viewing experience. This research is crucial due to the increasing reliance
on online video content and the need for optimized video streaming technologies. The factors to be
investigated include:
