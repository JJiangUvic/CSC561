# YouTube Video Streaming Performance and Quality Assessment
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of YouTube video streaming performance and quality by analyzing various factors that impact the viewing experience. This research is crucial due to the increasing reliance on online video content and the need for optimized video streaming technologies. The factors to be investigated include:

•	GPU decoding performance

•	Network environment parameters (latency and packet loss)

•	Video quality(4K-8K)

•	Impact of modern video codecs (AV1 and VP9)

While various studies have explored aspects of video streaming performance, there is limited research that combines GPU decoding, network parameters, video quality, and codec analysis within a controlled virtual environment. Previous efforts have often focused on isolated factors or lacked comprehensive assessments.

The approach will involve setting up a simplified hardware environment to manipulate and monitor the selected variables , including GPU decoding performance: Assembly the environment to with different GPU models. A set of standardized video streams will be utilized to assess GPU decoding efficiency. Monitoring tools will be employed to measure GPU utilization, decoding speed, and any potential bottlenecks. On the other hand, the evaluation also utilize tools similar to the tc (Traffic Control) tools for network parameter control and configure YouTube settings to use AV1 and VP9 codecs. The project focuses will be on a rapid but rigorous analysis of these factors. 

Expected Deliverables and Timeline

Week 1: Project setup, virtual machine configuration, and network parameter control

Week 2: GPU decoding performance assessment and preliminary video quality analysis

Week 3: Final video quality assessment, codec analysis, and report preparation

Week 4: Reports

This project aims to provide initial insights into YouTube video streaming performance and quality within a tight three-week timeline. While the scope is limited, the rapid assessment will yield valuable data on GPU decoding, network parameters, and codec impact. The results will contribute to our understanding of these critical factors in online video streaming.
